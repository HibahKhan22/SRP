# Selina Revino Photography Business
A repo for the Selina Revino Photography Business project for FBLA. In today's day and age, we have many options to choose from, but nowhere to start. For photography businesses, we see the same pattern, except that users face a big issue with quality. At Selina Revino Photography, our services expand on many gaps in the market today. From integrating ADA features to adding minicourses, our business has it all. As you read through, you will see how we made every single step possible.
